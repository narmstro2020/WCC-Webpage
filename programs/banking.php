 $testimonies=["I graduated in 2014 and the Finance Academy was the best class I ever took in my time at WC.  Not only because Mrs. Burns (Now Mrs. Stigger) is awesome, but I truly learned so much that prepared me for college.  I ended up graduating from the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois and because of my experience in the FA, I was prepared more so than a lot of my fellow business school colleagues.  Not only the business material but the personal finance ideas I learned were extremely beneficial.  Most people complain they never learn about taxes and investing and 'real world stuff' until it hits them and they aren't prepared, however the FA prepares you for exactly those things.  I absolutely loved the FA and looked forward to it everyday.  Lastly I'll never forget to pay myself first and making millions of dollars in Cash Flow (C) was pretty cool too!","The Finance Academy was one of the best decisions that I made in high school.  It gave me an opportunity to learn about the impacts of business on the world and how it relates to my personal finances.  Through all the Dave Ramsey videos or the long games of Monopoly and Cash Flow, the whole goal was to teach you how important your personal finances are.  You would be surprised how many people I came across in college who didn't know how to create a budget and stick to it.  The FA also introduced me to the world of Accounting, which I went on to study in college.  Although it's hard to grasp at first, once you understand the basics of accounting, your knowledge of handling business changes drastically and you are able to see problems and solutions that nobody else can see.  Without the Finance Academy, I wouldn't be where I am today...an Accountant!  The lessons that I learned and the friends that I made in those classes got me to where I am today","Finance Academy was the best decision I made in high school!  The class was full of useful information that I actually felt like I would use (and HAVE used) in real life.  I also made so many friends in Finance Academy.  We created a community in the classroom that really felt like a family.  Mrs. Stigger is such a great teacher and she taught us so much about finance while making the class fun.  It's one of the things I miss most from high school!
","The Finance Academy introduced me to the world of business and allowed me to discover my passion in Accounting.  Additionally, the FA taught me essential skills such as, building credit, investing and saving.  Now that I have started my career, these topics are essential to my success and need to be a mandatory part of high school curriculum.  Without the Finance Academy I would not have been exposed to Business since it is not widely advertised in the environment I grew up in.  Due to the Finance Academy, I have graduated from The Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington, have completed my first year with PriceWaterhouseCoopers, passed all 4 of my CPA exams, and many more accomplishments throughout my career thus far!  The FA truly changed my life for the better and I try to give back as much to the program as I can by now being a board member!
