 $testimonies=['â€œUse your resources, never allow apathy to overcome your
 potential and always ask questions. This program bolstered my
 skills and pushed me to create my own digital content which has
 award me with brand collaborations, freelance jobs and
 internship opportunities. Furthermore, the program is an
 essential stepping-stone to the endless possibilities to come and
 excel in college. Your teachers are an invaluable resource and
 they will always be there to help you. I have gained discipline, a
 strong sense of professionalism and instincts which have served
 me well. As my college career has come to an end and I will
 
 begin my journalism career in France, I urge you to push
 yourself beyond your limits. Find a mentor, network with others,
 and be curious. Your best memories can be found on the other
 side of fear, so take that first step. Ask all questions, apply for
 those scholarships, network and attend college. The dream is
 free, but the hustle is sold separately."'];
