 $testimonies=["I gained experience with the programs that architects use in the business world, and made connections that will help me advance my career through the ACE mentoring program.","Taught me a lot of engineering aspects. How to do certain things concerning engineering and architectural designs. I worked in CAD and all sorts of things. Helped me boost my knowledge to become an Architectural Engineer. And since I was in engineering I learned things that a normal Architect wouldn't and that's amazing. Never know if you would want to switch fields or electrical problems can show up while designing a building. ","I learned how to handle certain situations better. How to do better under pressure, and how to be the best at everything I do."];
