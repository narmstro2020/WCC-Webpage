 $testimonies=["Taking classes in the career center changed how I view school. Before the career center I didn't know what I was going to go to college for but when I took the Graphic Design class I knew what I wanted to do.","It helped me understand the various aspects of graphic design and how it affects the world. It also gave me the chance to experience basically being a graphic designer. That helps me out a lot because I plan on pursuing a career in visual communications.","I have developed skills for graphic design that may be necessary for industrial design. I have more knowledge in equipment and can do many of it on my own.","I learned more than enough skills and techniques to jumpstart me on getting a degree in Graphic Design."];
