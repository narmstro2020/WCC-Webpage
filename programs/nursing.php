 $classOneInfo="Everybody knows that the nursing profession has two different sidesâ€”it is both science and art. That said, nursing as a science is more apparent.  Nursing involves all the scientific disciplines of formal sciences, natural sciences, social sciences and applied sciences.
 Meanwhile, the art of nursing is more than a great deal of science. It is more than just knowing; it is doing. You must have emotional intelligence; It bridges information from nurses to patients in a skillful way. It is the application of all the science known to nursing to give the utmost care the patient needs.";
