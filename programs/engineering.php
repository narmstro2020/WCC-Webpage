 $testimonies=["The best impact of the Walker Career Centerâ€™s pre-engineering program is that it provides high school students with hands-on experiences of real engineering processes at a very early stage in their careers.  The experience I gained has led me to pursue engineering as a lifelong passion.","The engineering program is hands down the most influential experience you can go through, not only for people interested in engineering but those who just want to experience the world on a whole new level. It was genuinely so captivating and educating, that I would have been willing to go through it a hundred more times."," The pre engineering program is the perfect way to jumpstart your career. Not only that, but if you really take advantage of it and the knowledge offered by it, you can have some of the best times of your life.","The engineering program at the Walker Career Center is top tier.  Not only did the technical skills I developed during my time there help me tremendously at Purdue, they also gave me a leg up on all of my peers coming in as a freshman."," I love that it shows different areas of engineering and it offered many opportunities both inside and outside of the classroom.  I also really enjoyed how engaging the projects were.","Personally, it was engaging and showed a variety of opportunities, which allowed me to hone in on the major that worked best for me.","The engineering program at the Walker Career Center was an opportunity that has inspired me for life.","Through the years of being in Engineering, I have always enjoyed the freedom we are given when it comes to creativity. This freedom has allowed me to really discover my interests in programming and working with robots or even running CNC mills. I most definitely recommend this program to anyone with some interests in robots or the understanding of engineering as these classes have given me a wide range of skills and information."];
