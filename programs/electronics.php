 $testimonies=["You have the perfect mix of getting down to business and having genuine conversations to better get to know your students. It was thoroughly appreciated.
 Your positive reinforcement was consistent and refreshing.
 There was never a time that any wrong answers given were not explained to us so that we did understand. You know, ACTUALLY teaching students vs just hitting bullet points in a curriculum that you were required to check off.
 Never a day I dreaded coming to your class.","I remember you trying hard not just to give your students the answer to a question. You attempted to teach some critical thinking skills. More importantly, in my job function, I must impart my knowledge to my less experienced colleagues. I try to use “The Griffin Method” to force the junior techs to learn how to ask the right questions so they can get the answer on their own.
 I also remember you treating most of your students like adults, even when we didn’t necessarily deserve to be treated that way. I am certain that I never showed you that I appreciated this, but please know that it was highly appreciated and that I respected you more for it.
 I would love to retake another of your classes—my junior and senior years of high school were the best two years of my formal education (K-12 and college). Almost entirely because of you and the opportunities presented to me as a result of being in your class.","This is something deserving more thought than a 2 minute quick post on facebook. Mr. Griffin is awesome and takes time to teach his students regardless of 90% of the class jacking around and not retaining anything   I'm still amazed at this man's resolve after dealing with my class cause I know there were only 3 of us really learning the stuff cause we wanted to. Always gonna greet him with a smile. I wouldn't be doing what I am today without him! Electrical knowledge in mechanical work is an everyday use for me."];
