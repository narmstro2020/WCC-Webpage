 $testimonies=['"The CS pathway is an absolute must if you want to go into robotics or STEM in any way. I learned so much about how to think critically and solve problems”','"Computer science has opened many new pathways for my life that i would have never expected to arise"','"The CS pathway is perfect for anyone regardless of experience or previous knowledge. Not only can a complete beginner learn to make a program in multiple languages but more experienced coders are challenged and motivated to go beyond their current skills."','"The computer science course at Warren Central is a stepping stone to an entire untapped market for future computer enthusiasts. If you\'re a little nerdy, you\'ll fit right in."','"It\'s definitely a different kind of experience coming into your CS class everyday and have more fun than you expected to. I always leave this class with a smile and always enjoy my time there. Surely a class I\'ll remember for a long time."'];
