 $programOverview="Computer programmers write and test code that allows applications and programs to function properly and learn to turn program designs into instructions that a computer can follow. Students learn four programming languages, troubleshooting and problem solving skills, concentration, code writing, program testing, how to find and fix errors, industry-level design techniques, app deployment and implementation, as well as logic and reasoning.";
 $classOneTitle="Computer Science 1";
 $classOneInfo="In Computer Science 1 you build your own App! This course gives you the foundations of programming using the Code.org platform. In addition to programming, you will explore how the Internet really works, how pictures are sent bit by bit and even dive into Cybersecurity and learn about cryptography and security.";
 $classTwoTitle="Computer Science 2";
 $classTwoInfo="Computer Science 2 builds upon the skills learned in CS 1, but you build software and apps from scratch! Start with a blank, empty programming environment and create whatever your mind can dream up. You will use professional, industry-level software and languages to improve your skills in the foundations and push yourself to more advanced skills. You will dive into Game Design, Native applications and much more!"; 
 $classThreeTitle="Computer Science 3: Software Development";
 $classThreeInfo="Time to put your skills to the test and create a mobile, data-based application for a company or agency. You will follow the Software Development Life Cycle and create an app which will be used in the real-world either in the school or in the community abroad. You will earn the right to call yourself a Developer!";
 $classFourTitle="Computer Science 3: Cybersecurity";
 $classFourInfo="In this PLTW based course, you will explore the world of Cybersecurity. You will learn how to protect personal computers, small LAN networks and larger web-based networks. You will learn how hackers are able to penetrate a system and how to stop them. You will even get to design your own secure network!";

 $partners=["SEP offers the Computer Science 3 Software Development students a look at life in the software world. They offer tours to our students, that isn't available anywhere else. At the start of first semester, the staff at SEP will conduct some training with the students to help with design thinking and software structure. At the end of second semester, they host the app presentations and offer great constructive feedback and support for the students."];

 $testimonies=['"The CS pathway is an absolute must if you want to go into robotics or STEM in any way. I learned so much about how to think critically and solve problems”','"Computer science has opened many new pathways for my life that i would have never expected to arise"','"The CS pathway is perfect for anyone regardless of experience or previous knowledge. Not only can a complete beginner learn to make a program in multiple languages but more experienced coders are challenged and motivated to go beyond their current skills."','"The computer science course at Warren Central is a stepping stone to an entire untapped market for future computer enthusiasts. If you\'re a little nerdy, you\'ll fit right in."','"It\'s definitely a different kind of experience coming into your CS class everyday and have more fun than you expected to. I always leave this class with a smile and always enjoy my time there. Surely a class I\'ll remember for a long time."'];
