 $testimonies=['"The CS pathway is an absolute must if you want to go into robotics or STEM in any way. I learned so much about how to think critically and solve problems” -- Knight Wolff, AP CS','"Computer science has opened many new pathways for my life that i would have never expected to arise" -- Ronald Parsons, CS 1, CS 2, CS 3','"The CS pathway is perfect for anyone regardless of experience or previous knowledge. Not only can a complete beginner learn to make a program in multiple languages but more experienced coders are challenged and motivated to go beyond their current skills." -- Kyle Aksamit, CS 1, AP CS','"The computer science course at Warren Central is a stepping stone to an entire untapped market for future computer enthusiasts. If you\'re a little nerdy, you\'ll fit right in." - Hannah Mayorga, CS 1, CS 2, AP CS'];
